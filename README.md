# csvtohtml

It's script which can translate a csv file to HTML table.
You have to possible solutions, with and without libraries.
In the first solution use PrettyTable, in second it's a
little bit more complex.

It's useful with Web projects where user need a fast implementation
for import csv to website and rendered in time.

Kind regards,
